# Ourairyu

I'm sure you may have a question when you see the title of this repo,

**What does the Ourairyu mean?**

OK, let me tell you now.

**Ourairyu is the Romanization of Japanese for 欧雷流. It means everything about me.**

This repo hosts part of the source code of my personal website [Ourai.WS](https://ourai.ws/).
